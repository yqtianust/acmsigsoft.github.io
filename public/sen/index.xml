&lt;p>Peter Henderson started the &lt;em>Software Engineering Education (SEEd)&lt;/em> column in &lt;em>SEN&lt;/em> in 2003. In 2009, Mark Ardis became the lead author of the column with Peter continuing as co-author. There have been occasional guest authors over the years as well. Here are links to text of each of the columns in the ACM Digital Library, along with their major topics.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Mark Doernhoefer wrote the &lt;em>Surfing the Net for Software Engineering Notes&lt;/em> column for &lt;em>SEN&lt;/em>. Beginning with the January 2001 issue of &lt;em>SEN&lt;/em>, Mark switched over from coverage of software engineering discussions on the Usenet newsgroups to software engineering-related sites on the World Wide Web.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The full text of the &lt;em>Surfing&lt;/em> columns are available to members in the &lt;a href="http://portal.acm.org/browse_dl.cfm?linked=1&amp;amp;part=newsletter&amp;amp;idx=J728&amp;amp;coll=portal&amp;amp;dl=ACM">ACM Digital Library&lt;/a>. In addition, all of the links Mark has mentioned in his columns are collected here in one place, for your surfing ease and pleasure:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Instructions for Conference and Workshop Organizers</title><link>https://www2.sigsoft.org/sen/instructions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www2.sigsoft.org/sen/instructions/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="instructions-for-conference-and-workshop-organizers">Instructions for Conference and Workshop Organizers&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Software Engineering Notes (SEN)&lt;/strong> provides ACM SIGSOFT-affiliated conferences, workshops or symposiums an opportunity to publish proceedings and/or meeting summaries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To have a meeting, panel, session, keynote or other summary published, organizers should prepare, using the &lt;a href="https://www2.sigsoft.org/sen/guideline/" title="guideline">standard SEN format guidelines&lt;/a>, an MS Word or LaTex document consisting of:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>the title and authors (with affiliations and email addresses),&lt;/li>
&lt;li>an abstract of the summary, and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the full summary.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The abstract will appear in the hardcopy version of SEN and the full summary will appear in the Digital Library version.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Software Engineering Notes (SEN)</title><link>https://www2.sigsoft.org/sen/sen/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www2.sigsoft.org/sen/sen/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="about">About&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Software Engineering Notes (SEN) is an informal publication of the ACM Special Interest Group on Software Engineering (SIGSOFT). SEN is hence appropriate for contributions in all areas of software engineering, therein included (but not limited to) requirements, specification, design and implementation methods, software maintenance, reuse and re-engineering, quality assurance, measurement and evaluation, software processes, automated tools, practical experience, and related issues. SIGSOFT seeks to address research and development issues in these areas and to provide a common ground for both, through sponsorship of conferences, symposia and workshops, and the publication of SEN.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Software Engineering Notes (SEN) Publication Guidelines</title><link>https://www2.sigsoft.org/sen/guideline/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www2.sigsoft.org/sen/guideline/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="publication-guidelines">Publication Guidelines&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="submitting-to-sen">Submitting to SEN&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Material for publication in &lt;strong>Software Engineering Notes (SEN)&lt;/strong> should be submitted via email to &lt;strong>editors_sigsoft [at] acm.org&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Contributions can be &lt;em>articles&lt;/em>, &lt;em>reports&lt;/em>, &lt;em>reviews&lt;/em>, &lt;em>columns&lt;/em>, &lt;em>announcements&lt;/em>, or &lt;em>book reviews&lt;/em>.
The submission of &lt;em>articles&lt;/em> is however restricted to scientific/research articles that are part of a workshop for which SEN has agreed to be the publisher.
Other scientific/research articles, i.e., articles that are sent unsolicited and could have been submitted to a regular journal or workshop for review, will no longer be published in SEN. As &lt;em>columns&lt;/em>,
we instead welcome contributions that discuss topics of interest among SIGSOFT members and the software engineering community at large.
Columns should normally not be longer than 4 pages (exceptions may be allowed on a case-by-case basis) and trigger further discussion among community members.
Finally, as &lt;em>reports&lt;/em>, we welcome summary reports from workshops conducted under the umbrella of ICSE, ASE, ESEC/FSE and other major SIGSOFT sponsored conferences.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
